#### Creating a Dirt and Water Detection model for floor cleaning Robots can help many floor cleaning robotic companies to become more autonomous, both in terms of their navigation skills but also in their capabilities of analyzing the surrounding environment. Most robot cleaners are incapable of sanitizing floors. If the correct cleanser is not utilized, cleaning off built-up dirt and debris has minimal effect on the quantity of bacteria and viruses that live on the surface. This model can classify the floor material and provide an input to the robot to modify the disinfection and strain removal liquids. Furthermore, giving an appropriate vision detection model can guide the robot to clean the filth region rather than the entire floor. This model may considerably minimize power consumption, floor cleaning and disinfection material, as well as assist in changing correct moping bases for hard dirt and water. The publications I discovered only focused on implementing deep learning models, with little explanation.Â This is why I want to construct several categorization algorithms and compare them to have a better understanding.
