Keywords: Image Classification, Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Deep Learning. 

Description: For this project, I will be utilizing the FLOBOT Perception Dataset, which was gathered by Flobot, a European Floor Cleaning Robotics firm. I will utilize their dataset to build a model to identify dirt and items on the floor, and then propose a vision system based on the CV frameworks. Classification models will be trained to recognize the objects and dirt on the floor.

Intellectual Merit: Creating a Dirt and Object Detection Model for floor cleaning can assist many floor-cleaning robotic firms  in becoming more autonomous, both in terms of navigation abilities and the capacity to evaluate the surrounding environment. The publications I discovered were all about implementing deep learning models with little explanation. This is why I want to create and test several categorization algorithms in order to have a better understanding.

Data Sourcing: The data will be source from FLOBOT (Floor washing Robot) an European company http://lcas.github.io/FLOBOT/. The data has 2174 sample images inside the supermarket.
