Keywords: Image Classification, Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Deep Learning. 

Description: For this project, I will be using FLOBOT Perception Dataset which is collected by Flobot. I will use their datset to create my own dataset of dirt on the floor and then proposes a vision system based on the CV frameworks for Object and dirt detections on the floor analyze it. Classification models will be trained to identify the objects and dirt.

Intellectual Merit: Creating a Dirt and Object Detection model for floor cleaning Robots can help many floor cleaning robotic companies to become more autonomous, both in terms of their navigation skills but also in their capabilities of analyzing the surrounding environment. The publications I discovered only focused on implementing deep learning models, with little explanation.Â This is why I want to construct several categorization algorithms and compare them to have a better understanding.

Data Sourcing: The data will be source from FLOBOT (FLOor washing RObot) an European companyhttp://lcas.github.io/FLOBOT/. The data has 2174 sample images inside the supermarket.
